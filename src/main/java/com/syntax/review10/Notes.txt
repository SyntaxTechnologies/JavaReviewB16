Interface:
    Interfaces are contracts that helps multiple classes stay on the same page. They
    are also used to achieve abstraction and polymorphism.
    Most of the time they contain abstract methods which other classes implement.
    Interfaces also help us achieve multiple inheritance.
when should we use abstract classes and when interface.
    When there is no or very fewer similarities between two classes then we use
    interafces. When a lot of instance fields and methods are same in multiple
    classes we can use abstract classes.
Encapsulation:
    Encapsulation allows us to write more secure code by making the fields private.
    we create classes in which fields are defined as instance fields and getter setter methods are created
    to control who can access and change the values of those fileds.
Collections framework:
    The classes(ArrayList) inside collections framework are not fixed in size.
    These classes have built-in methods.
Arrays:
    They very memory efficient. because we can use primitive data types with arrays
    we can save upto 4x memory
