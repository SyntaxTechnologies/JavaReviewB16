FileHandling:
    Reading/writing/deleting/moving/editing files is called file handling in programming.
Steps:
    1)We must have the location of the file.
    2) navigating to the location of file or bringing the file into the memory.
    for example FileInputStream to read and FileOutputStream to write the data.
    3) Software/ Libraries to handle that file for example XSSFWorkBook for xlsx files
    and Properties for .properties file.
